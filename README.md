# Alone

Alone is a first person action adventure game set in a chinese prison.
I created this game around 2005 and was one of the bigger personal projects I have worked on.

I cannot take all the credit for the game just the programming all the art and assets were done by a friend.

This game was created using Ogre3d http://www.ogre3d.org/ everything else is custom created for this game.

I will be adding a download link for the exe shortly this is currently all the source code.
