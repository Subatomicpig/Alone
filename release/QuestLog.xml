 brute, not even worth the dirt we walk in. He has been trying to 
 make our lives difficult since he has been admitted into the 
 empire" GeminiTwinsInitialDialogue02="
 
 We have developed opposing opinions but have tried to be civil.
 However, it's time for a change." GeminiTwinsInitialDialogue03="
 
 If you could show him that we possess some physical merit, it
 might set him straight. We would like you to cause him some 
 pain. A knock out would be preferable." GeminiTwinsInitialDialogue04="
 
 Go speak with Johnny 666. He is known in the Empire to be quite
 the fighter. He will train you." GeminiTwinsFailure="

yourself to think. It's time to act." GeminiTwinsCompleted="Hope you didn't go through too much pain. This should compensate your efforts"/>

 that you fear Lin Ma" GeminiTwinsCompleted="
 We are impressed but frankly you should not waste our time 
 without following through your task. Go speak with Santoso."/>
